## This python program will use reinforcement learning to teach a modified version of the pac-man game to solve a maze.
## In general, we implemented the psuedocode as expressed in the lecture slides and adjusted things where they needed to be changed.

## We have modified the analysis.py, qlearningAgents.py, and valueIterationAgents.py files in order to pass the tests provided.
